   postOrder (Node Version)
   -----------
   Given the root of a tree print out the values of the nodes in post-order.
   Print each value on a separate line.

   Example:
   If the tree is:
          5
       /  |  \
      3   9   8
        / | \

   The output should be:

   1
   2
   9
   8
   5

   If the root is null, do nothing.

   -----------
   Given the root of a tree print out the values of the nodes in post-order.

     3 -> []
     9 -> [4, 1, 2]

   sumTree (Node Version)
   -----------
   Given a tree built with the Node class (with integer values), compute and return the sum of all the node values.

       /  |  \
      3   9   8
        / | \

   sumTree (Map Version)
   -----------

   compute the sum of all nodes.
   Example:
   For a tree represented as:
     5 -> [3, 9, 8]
     3 -> []
     9 -> [4, 1, 2]
     4 -> []
     1 -> []
     2 -> []
   the method should return 32.

  /*
   findRoot
   -----------
   Given a tree represented as a map where each key is a parent node and the value is a list of its children,
   find the root of the tree. The root is the node with no parents.
   Example:
   If the tree is represented as:
     20 -> [40]
     8  -> []
     30 -> []
     10 -> [20, 30, 99]
     40 -> []
     99 -> [8]
   then the method should return 10.

  You can assume the tree is non-null and well-formed.

   Hint: No recursion needed! Think about how you would do this by hand.

   maxDepth (Node Version)
   -----------
   Compute the maximum depth of a tree using the Node class. The depth is the number of nodes along
   the longest path from the root down to the farthest leaf. The root is at depth 1. If the tree is null, return 0.
   Example:
   For a tree structured as:
          A

      B   E   C
      |      / \

   the maximum depth is 4 (A->C->D->Z).
